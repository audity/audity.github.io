## What is scrum?
Scrum helps teams deliver products in an incremental way. Its split up into sprints, which should be less than a month long, where the team works on specific goals. The scrum team always tries to improve their procedures and adapts to new challenges. 

## Who is in a Scrum Team?
A scrum team is responsible for pretty much all work is required to delivered a product and generally should have less than 10 people.

### Product Owner
The product owner tries to create value in the product for stakeholders:
- creating and ordering task backlogs
- representing the needs of the customer
- makes decisions

### Scrum Master
The Scrum master helps by:
- empowering developers to be self-managed
- break down blockers that are in front of the team
- establish goals for the product the team is making
- in general, helping the team become more effective

### Developers
Developers work on the product and also:
- create a plan for the sprint 
- producing quality work
- self-managing to acheive sprint goals

## Scrum Events
### Sprints
During sprints, nothing should be changed to endanger the sprint goal, but the scope can be renegotiated with the scrum master if more information is learned. Each sprint should be between 1-4 weeks long and end with working software. 

Theres two goals:
- Product Goal: What the product ideally should look like.
- Spring Goal: What are we doing this sprint to acheive the product goal? 

### Core Components of Sprint Planning
1. Product Owner should make sure that developers are prepared to discuss the backlog
2. How will this sprint help us acheive our Product Goal?
3. What can we do this sprint and what is the definition of a task done?
4. How should a specific task get done?

### Sprint Review/Retro
The team should:
- Talk about what items are done and not done
- Discuss what went well/what could've been improved
- Discuss how the backlog is looking and if theres any changes to product timelines or priorities
- Team can then use that information to plan for the next sprint
