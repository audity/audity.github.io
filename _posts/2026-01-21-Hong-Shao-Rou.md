Ingredients:
- 5lb pork belly with skin (with ribs, even better!)
- 3/4 cups regular soysauce
- 300-350g sugar
- 3-5 star anise
- cooking wine

Directions:
1. Cut the pork belly into 1 inch cubes and wash the pork belly 3 times to soak out the blood
2. Get rid of the water in the pork belly (the less water the better)
3. Add soy sauce, sugar and star anise and meat into the pot
4. Pour cooking wine until the meet is covered
5. Cook on the stove until boiling, skim off the foam. Taste and adjust flavor.
6. Leave in a slow cooker with high heat for about 6 hours.
7. Do not skim off the oil until it's ready, in order to keep the meat moist.
