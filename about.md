# Hi! I'm Audrey.

I've only been a software engineer for two years, but I decided that the best time to start a blog is right now. 

You probably won't find anything profound here. Mostly just notes, little opinions and how-tos on the things that I learn. I find that if I don't keep track of what I learn, I tend to lose it. 

I chose to start a blog mainly due to its anonymity. I have some thoughts to share, but I don't know if I want the whole world to find them just yet. 

This blog is a work in progress. Hopefully overtime I can change the visuals of this blog to what I desire it to be!
